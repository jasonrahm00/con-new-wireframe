I was hired at the CU College of Nursing to manage their website and prepare it to be re-built in the Sitefinity CMS. To facilitate planning of the re-platform, I built a rudimentary website using AngularJS. The purpose of this application was to help organize pages and main navigation and showcase a few ideas to Central IT - most notably an eCommerce style faceted search for degrees programs.
