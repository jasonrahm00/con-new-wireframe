  <h2>Mega Menu and Mobile Compatibility</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>There need to be main landing pages for all of the top-leve nav items, but we also need a to click and expose submenus on mobile (maybe on desktop to, for accessibility). Look at <a href="http://regis.edu" target="_blank">Regis University</a> mobile view for inspiration.</li>
    <li>We could combine the Admissions and Programs under one mega, mega menu and use the main nav component as a click target to expose the menu. Admissions and Programs will become their own headers that are clickable to the page, as on the main <a href="http://ucdenver.edu" target="_blank">UC Denver</a> page, but I don't like this option. Menu will become too jumbled too fast.</li>
    <li>Another option is to eliminate sub-menus altogether and drop them onto landing pages. This could be a down-the-road option as the programs and admissions pages will need some custom sorting to get users to the right page. Look at main <a href="http://colorado.edu" target="_blank">CU Boulder</a> site for inspiration.</li>
    <li><a href="http://wpi.edu" target="_blank">Worcester Polytechnic</a> uses an expand button that toggles the submenu while still making the main page/header a clickable link. Might not be the best solution, but it is a solution. Separate toggle button and link with a vertical line.</li>
    <li><a href="http://sju.edu" target="_blank">Saint Joseph's University</a> has an additional "about" button for each nav page that shows up in mobile and desktop that will take you to the landing page.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Apply Now Link</h2>
  <p>There is an <a href="http://ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/nursing/programs-admissions/Pages/Apply%20Now.aspx/" target="_blank">Apply Now</a> page on the site that could be the destination of the 'apply now' button. The page and links will need to be redone. Ideally it'll target the specific application page for that program.</p>
  <p>We will need some sort of "application process" or "how to apply" page for each degree level, so they can come prepared with necessary documents.</p>

  <h2>Subpages To Keep</h2>
  <p>Consider keeping landing pages for Undergrad, Graduate, Specialties and Additional academics programs and expose all available degrees on those pages. Single link to the program page. No extra links or unnecessary pages???</p>
